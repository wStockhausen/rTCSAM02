# rTCSAM02 
R package with functions for making and extracting results from TCSAM02 (formerly TCSAM2015) model runs for the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Tanner crab stock assessment.

[TCSAM02](https://github.com/wStockhausen/tcsam02) is a modeling framework based on the AD Model Builder c++ automatic differentiation library for stage/size-specific fishery stock assessment models for the Tanner crab (*Chionoecetes bairdi*) stock in the eastern Bering Sea. This package provides a library of functions to run models and extract results. The R package [rCompTCMs](https://github.com/wStockhausen/rCompTCMs) provides a related library of functions to compare results (convergence information, model fits to data, predicted and projected quantities, management quantities) from multiple models using standardized plots, tables, and reports. 

## Installation

The following software is required to install the package:

- R version 4.0.0 or newer
- the following R packages 
  - cowplot
  - dplyr
  - ggplot2
  - graphics
  - grDevices
  - grid
  - magrittr
  - reshape2
  - sqldf
  - stats
  - stringr
  - tcltk
  - tibble
  - tidyr
  - utils
  - [wtsPlots](https://github.com/wStockhausen/wtsPlots)
  - [wtsUtilities](https://github.com/wStockhausen/wtsUtilities)
  
All packages except the last two are available on CRAN. The last two are available 
on GitHub.

## Configuring as an R project using RStudio 

To create a local version of this R project using RStudio:

1. copy the url of the repository from GitHub
2. start RStudio and: 
    a. go to "New Project"
    b select "Version Control/Git"
    c. paste in the repository url, which will also fill in the default project name
    d. click "Create Project"
    
You can install the current version of rTCSAM02 from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("wStockhausen/rTCSAM02")
```

## Using the package

The principal functions for running a TCSAM02 model are [runTCSAM02](reference/runTCSAM02.html) and [runJitter](reference/runJitter.html). The former runs a single model (but can be used in a loop to run multiple models) and the latter makes multiple runs of a single model with randomized ("jittered") initial parameter values in order to determine convergence properties and provide support for the maximum likelihood solution.

[getResLst](reference/getResLst.html) is used to convert the output text (input/output parameter csv, report, and/or sdrep) files from a TCSAM02 model run to a more compact R object (of class "tcsam02.resLst"), which provides the principal object for functions that extract a dataframe in standardized format of a subset of the model results (the "getMDFR" functions). This function encapsulates the getPrs(), getRep(), and getStd() functions that read the input/output parameter csv, report, and sdreport files (respectively) created during a TCSAM02 model run. The function [getResLsts](reference/getResLsts.html) allows the user to convert multiple model runs to tcsam02.resLst objects. Other functions that extract model output include readCorFile() (the .cor file) and readParFile() (the .par file).
